<h2>Further information</h2>

<p>Please remember: if you want to install the game, you will need 128x128 base
package + Simutrans executable for your operating system. Don't forget to
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/simutrans/files/simutrans/">download that</a>,
too!</p>

<p>Currently there exist also other image sets for Simutrans, bringing really
large variety to the game. You can learn more about them on page
<a href="http://www.simutrans.com/paksets.htm">about paksets</a>.</p>

<p>Are you <em>missing an object</em> that was in old versions, but has been removed,
such as a factory? Can't load old savegame? Try the
<a href="download/pak128-compatibility-1.4.4.zip">compatibility pack</a>
which includes backup of these objects. Older releases are available
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/simutrans/files/pak128/">on sourceforge</a>,
too.</p>

<p>Nightly builds of pak128 are available at
<a href="http://nightly.simutrans-germany.com/">nightly page</a>.
These are snapshots of development in between versioned releases, and may be
broken or incompatible - on the other hand, they might include new features as
well. Remember that for nightly pak you need nightly of the program, too. They
are available on the same page. For information about recent improvements, try
the web archive of <a href="http://svnlogs.simutrans.com">development logs</a>.</p>

<p>Want to paint some addons for this pakset?
<a href="http://graphics.simutrans.com/thumbnails.php?album=9">Graphic archive</a>
has lots of templates and helpful parts, and on 
<a href="http://www.simutrans-germany.com/wiki/wiki/tiki-index.php">Simutrans wiki</a>
should be enough to get you started.</p>

<p>Last source export was at <span title="Subversion">revision 1111</span>, available as a
<a href="http://128.simutrans.com/download/128svn-export@1111.7z">zip file</a>
(60&nbsp;MB) and
<a href="https://github.com/sdog/simutrans-pak128">on GitHub</a>.
These materials are redacted because there are parts that authors wished to remain
private. We are working to replace these parts and achieve
<span title="Artistic license v2">open source status</span>.
For now, the exports include all important material that an author could
need as a reference, even after redaction.</p>
